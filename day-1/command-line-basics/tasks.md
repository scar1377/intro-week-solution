Day 1 tasks

Command line tasks

1. Use the command `echo` to print a message `hello <your-name>` to the terminal

2. Print your current working directory to the terminal

3. Change directory back to your home directory ( if you’re not already there ) and then use `mkdir` to create a new directory called `northcoders`

4. Change directory into the `northcoders` directory and print your current working directory again - always double checking where you are.

5. Create some directories inside northcoders called `intro-week`, `fundamentals`, `backend`, `frontend` and `projects`.

6. List all the directory contents of `northcoders` - you should be able to see the 5 directories you’ve just created.

7. `cd` into your `intro-week` directory

8. Create a new blank file in your `intro-week` directory called `questions.txt` - look up the commands to do this if you need to: you can find some good documentation online here: http://oliverelliott.org/article/computing/tut_unix/

9. Use the `cd ..` command in your terminal. Then print your current working directory to work out where you are. What is happening when you run the command `cd ..` ?

10. Run `man ls` command in your terminal. Scroll down through this manual to try and figure out what the `-a` addition to the command `ls` will do. Then run the command `ls -a` in your home directory.

11. Try navigating to your home directory and then run the command `ls -a` again but channel the output of this command into a text file called `directory-contents.txt`. Then use another command to read the contents of the `directory-contents.txt` file to check your work. Remember you’ll need to use the re-direct operator `>` to complete this task.

If you manage to complete all of the tasks above … nice one ! :muscle:
