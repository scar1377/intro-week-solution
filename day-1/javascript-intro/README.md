# Javascript intro tasks

## `exercises`

### `message.js`

There is a problem with `message.js` - correct the syntax in this file in order to correctly print the message to the terminal.

### Logs

In each of the files `log_0.js` to `log_9.js` you will find a line of code that is commented out.

For each file you will need to:

1. Un-comment the line of code

2. Write a few comments of your own predicting what will be printed to the the terminal.
   You could look this up but its better for you to try and use your intuition to help guide you in these tasks.
   Also, try to think about exactly how `console.log` is being called and what **arguments it takes**
3. Then execute the file with node and check your terminal to see what gets printed.

## `challenges`

Try and figure out what is going on in `poem.js`

## `explore`

Another more open-ended task in `rectangle.js`
