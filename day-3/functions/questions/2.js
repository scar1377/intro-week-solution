// Predict -> Observe -> Explain

// It is essential for you to start working out what the code will do before it is executed by the computer. In the snippet below try to work out what will be printed to the console and the exexcute the file with Node to see if you were right :)

function sum(a, b, c) {
  const total = a + b + c;
  return total;
}

// How many parameters are there in this function declaration ?
// What is the return value ?

const output1 = sum(100, 20, 4);
// What are the arguments for this function call / invocation ?
