# Remote Javascript basics

## How to use this repo

Each section is organised into **exercises**, **questions**, **challenges**, and **explore**

Not every topic will have all of these sections: sometimes there may only be an **exercises** and a **challenges** section

## Activities

- `exercises` 🖊️ - these tasks are designed for you to practice some of the essential skills in a particular topic

- `questions` ❓ - these tasks are designed to make you think critically about a given concept. They may employ a Predict observe explain format requiring you to think or contemplate a particular scenario and explain what will happen

- `challenges` 🧠 - tasks in here are designed to make you practice building/implementing functions that must fulfil certain behaviour. They are designed to encourage you to think and problem solve independently and also make sense of instructions.

- `explore` 🎨 - these tasks are purposely open-ended and designed to bring out your creative side. Coding is often about finding creative or imaginative solutions to problems and these tasks aim to get you thinking in this sort of way.

## Additional Files

You may notice that there are some additional files in this directory that we have not discussed. You will not need to look into or edit these files but here is a brief summary of their purposes:

- `package.json` and `package-lock.json` contain metadata about this project - you will be enlightened next week as to their true purpose.
- `.prettierrc` and `.prettierignore` contain config information for a specific VSCode extension which helps with code formatting.
- `.gitignore` contains the names of files and directories that we specifically do not want to include in our commits and push to GitHub - the importance of this will be explored next week.
